# Builder
A simple bash script I made overnight using notes from my Linux class.

This bash script is essentially a "wrapper" on using the g++ command.  
**Note:** This only works for C++ source files

### Usage
**builder \<file>**  

**Options:**  
**[-n | --name]**: Names the compiled file. (Default: file name)
